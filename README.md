# Project-Euler

This repository contains problems I solve from the [problem archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives) provided on the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) website.

Note that these are different from the [recent problems](https://projecteuler.net/recent) provided on the website.

At some later point, I might even include solutions to the recent problems.

For now, the convention is, the namespace for archived problems will begin with the letters `AP`. For e.g. For [problem 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2), the namespace will be `AP2.xxx` where `xxx` is a custom problem descriptor. For example for  [problem 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2), the namespace I have chosen is `AP2.EvenFibonacci`.
